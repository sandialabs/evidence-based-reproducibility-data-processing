# Evidence-Based Software Quality Practices for Computational Reproducibility Data Repository

This repository hosts scripts for processing raw data as part of the FY23 study conducted
by co-PIs Reed Milewicz and Miranda Mundt.

Other team members include:

- Christian Gilbertson
- Joshua Teves

Other related study artifacts including survey instruments, raw data, etc., can
be found [on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11150653).

These processing scripts and the accompanying data support the results presented
in the ACMREP'24 paper "Towards Evidence-Based Software Quality Practices for
Reproducibility: Practices and Aligned Software Qualities."
